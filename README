(old)
change for loop of animmirrorwave and animscattwave to call not full
wave plots and to set axis

change resplotmirror to accept minimum k and kappa

(new)
TEmatrix: constructs TE matrix for three-layer waveguide
TMmatrix: constructs TM matrix for three-layer waveguide
exploreModes: plots resonances of waveguide without scattering
resplot3layer: plots resonances of waveguide with incident wave
scattwave: plots three-layer waveguide w/ incident wave
scattwave2d: same as scattwave but plotted on x-y plane
animscattwave: animates scattwave2d through time
threelayergui: GUI to explore resplot3layer image to see animscattwave for various values

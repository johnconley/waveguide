(old)
change for loop of animmirrorwave and animscattwave to call not full
wave plots and to set axis

change resplotmirror to accept minimum k and kappa

optimization directory contains code to optimize absorption over the solar spectrum

visualization directory contains code to explore the resonances across angle and frequency of
incident light and explore how the waves travel through the waveguide

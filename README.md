The optimization directory contains code to optimize a solar cell for maximum absorbance.
The multilayerWrapper function calculates absorbance across the spectrum. See optimumStructure.m
for an example of how to use multilayerWrapper.

The visualization directory contains a GUI designed to explore the resonances of a three-layer
waveguide. The threelayergui function is the entry point to the application.
